course_content: |
  Students and scholars in the humanities generally rely on prefabricated 
  tools to guide and instruct their research and are reluctant to engage with 
  computers and technology through coding. This remains a major distinction 
  between the humanities and the sciences. The sciences design, create and 
  maintain their own relevant digital research environments and tools, while 
  the humanities make do with prefabricated, and often inappropriate, tools.

  At the moment, there are no broadly available academic programming courses 
  aimed at humanities scholars. However, coding skills are needed more now than 
  ever, and even more so in the future:

  1. They help students and researchers to understand the various 
     technologically mediated objects that they are studying.
  2. Developing custom tools, rather than using ready-made ones, can improve 
     the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and 
     quality) of its output.
  3. There is an ever-growing demand in the public and private sector for 
     academics who can read and write code.

  After completion of the module you will be able to: 
  1. apply knowledge of basic programming building blocks that carry over to almost all programming 
  languages;
  2. demonstrate knowledge of web-based, client and server side 
  services;
  3. display insight in technological aspects of humanities research;
  4. apply skills in analysing humanities questions and material from a coding 
  perspective;
  5. reflect on experience in project-based collaborative 
  humanities research.

time_requirement: |
     This is a online-first course. This means that, including the contact hours, 
     students are required to work on this course 21 hours a week. In order to 
     make this possible, a collaborative online possible is used to offer the 
     teaching.
     
     During the semester, the students will work on a group project. These 
     self-organized groups should meet regularly throughout the semester. 
     Feedback on the progress, by the instructors, teaching assistants and 
     peers, is offered during the plenary sessions and on the platform.

assessment:
  description: |
    Build an interface that visualizes group research
  review:
    - weekly assignments
    - Final presentation of the group project
  completion: |
     You pass if you completed all the weekly assignments and achieve at least 
     a 5.5 on the final assessment.
  criteria:
    - originality of the idea and research question;
    - implementation of that idea and question in code;
    - identification of the goals of the project, and its effectiveness 
      in addressing these goals;
    - degree to which it does, or does not, go beyond the stated goals to challenge 
      current practice.
    - quality of the presentation
  deadlines:
    - Weekly Assignment (week 1 â€“ 6)
    - Final Presentation (week 7)
