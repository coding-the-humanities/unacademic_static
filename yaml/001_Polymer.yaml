    Web Components are the future of web development, but what are they? 
    Remeber the <img> element, that allows you to embed an image to your 
    website? What if you could create your own custom element. For example 
    we could create an element called <my-clock> that would insert a clock 
    displaying the time. Like any other element we could then reuse our 
    clock element whenever and wherever we need. This is exactly what 
    web components allow us to do, to create custom HTML elements. 
    Web components enable truly encapsulated and reusable components for
    the web. This means we can easily create widgets and other useful
    elements that can be easily shared, without having to retype or 
    rework code. That is the beauty of web components.

  - title: Introduction
    description: >
      Polymer is a library build on top of web components making the 
      development of web components easier. Polymer has a certain way 
      of thinking how these web components are best used and created. 
      First familiarise yourself with Polymer and their methodology. 
      Check out the website and their introduction video.
    instructions:
      - Read up on Polymer by visiting their website
      - Watch the introduction video by Matthew McNulty

  - title: Environment
    description: >
      In order to create stunning web applications we can make use of 
      libraries or frameworks. These are a collection of sources that 
      allow for more functionalities and/or easier development. We are 
      using a library called Polymer. It is comprised of polymer.js 
      and platform.js. This allows for the use of webcomponents
      (EDIT>>>in more detail platform polyfill etc.).
      But we need the sources, so we need to set up an environment with 
      all the dependencies we need. The Polymer-book provides a 
      step by step instruction in their appendix-A on how to set up 
      this environemt. Create your environment so you can use Polymer 
      in your next assignments.
    instructions:
      - Set up your environment as described in appendix-A (Polymer-book)

  - title: Getting started
    description: >
      In this assignment you will learn about the way Polymer is set 
      up and use Polymers templating and data-binding functionalities 
      to create your first element. Templating means you can create a 
      reusable structure as a seperate HTML file. If you have multiple 
      templates, and they need to be able to communicate or pass data, 
      you can use data-binding. You will learn about these functionalities 
      and techniques by creating a simple first Polymer element. 
      To guide you trhough this process, head over to chapter 1 
      from the Polymer-book, and get started!
    instructions:
      - Create your first Polymer element as described in Chapter-1 (Polymer-book)

  - title: Refactor
    description: >
      Coding is as much refactoring as it is creating new code. Refactoring 
      is the process of improving the design of existing code. In this assignment 
      we are going to refactor your previous level0 project into a Polymer 
      project. Try to think of the design of your code, remove unused or redundant 
      code or perhaps add usefull comments. In level0 you created a simple 
      HTML file with some CSS. In this assignment the goal is to convert your 
      regular HTML file into a Polymer element and an index.html file 
      where it is displayed.
    instructions:
      - Use what you have learned from Chapter-1 to refactor your existing code. 
      - Refactor your code to be a single polymer element and display it in your index.html
