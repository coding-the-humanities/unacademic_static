  An enumeration is a list of objects that has been ordered in a certain way so each 
  of the objects inside the list has its unique place. The way arrays are ordered influences 
  the way we can manipulate them. With Javascript we have some techniques at our disposal 
  to alter these orders or use them to our advantage.

  - title: Count the computer way
    description: > You may have come across this concept before but in computer science 
    counting starts at 0. This is important to remember when working with arrays. It 
    means the second object in the array is assigned to the number 1. In HTML markup there
    are a couple of ways to display lists. The unordered list which means that the order is 
    not indexed with numbers, and the ordered list where every number has some text assigned 
    to it.

    - the numbers are scrambled 
    - Assign the correct index numbers

  - title: ForEach
    description: > An Array is a collection of objects, each of these objects are assigned
    a number, this indexation of arrays allows to target specific objects. In this way you
    can think of an array as an ordered list, and each object has its number assigned to it.
    ForEach is a technique that uses this index to iterate over the array and allows us to
    alter each object seperately with only one command. We simply state what we want to happen
    to a object inside the array, but use the properties unique to that object. So for each object
    inside the array we do something. The computer knows which object has what unique properties
    because they have their unique numbers assigned to them like an ordered list. This does mean 
    that the way you order your objects may be important.

  - title: Combine template repeat and polymer core rijksmuseum API 
    description: > In Polymer these concepts translate much in the same way but with 
    a few changes. It actually makes it easier, It combines the syntax that we have 
    already seen with forEach in Javascript and the each method with handlebars. By 
    inserting some syntax we know from JavaScript into our markup we can easily iterate over entire
    arrays and display them as we defined in our markup.
