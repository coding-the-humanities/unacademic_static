    Enumeration as you might have already guessed has something to do with numbers. 
    An enumeration is a list of objects that has been ordered in a certain way so each 
    of the objects inside the list has its unique place. The way arrays are ordered 
    influences the way we can manipulate them. In Javascript there are available 
    techniques to alter these orders or use them to our advantage.

    description: > 
      You may have come across this concept before but in computer science 
      counting starts at 0. This is important to remember when working with arrays. It 
      means the second object in the array is assigned to the digit 1. In HTML markup there
      are a couple of ways to display lists; the unordered list which means that the order is 
      not indexed with numbers, and the ordered list where every item has a number assigned.

    - the numbers are scrambled 
    - Assign the correct index numbers

  - title: ForEach
    description: > 
      An Array is a collection of objects, each of these objects is assigned
      a number. This indexation of arrays allows for targeting specific objects. In this way you
      can think of an array as an ordered list, and each object has its number assigned to it.
      ForEach is a technique that uses this index to iterate over the array and allows us to
      alter each object seperately with only one command. We simply state what we want to happen
      to an object inside the array, but use the properties unique to that object. So for each object
      inside the array we do something. The computer knows which object has which unique properties
      because they have their unique numbers assigned to them like an ordered list. This does mean 
      that the way you order your objects may be important.

    description: > 
      Because every object inside an array has its unique number, we can
      do some math with them. With math we can manipulate the way the array is ordered or 
      constructed. Or we can filter ......

  - title: Combine template repeat and polymer core rijksmuseum API 
    description: > 
      In Polymer these concepts translate much in the same way but with 
      a few changes. It actually makes it easier, combining the syntax that we have 
      already seen with forEach in Javascript and the each method with handlebars. By 
      inserting some JavaScript syntax into our markup we can easily iterate over entire
      arrays and display them as we defined in our markup.
