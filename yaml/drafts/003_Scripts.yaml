    So far you have included noscript inside your polymer element. The reason is
    because untill now we did not use the script functionalities. A script is 
    a small bit of code that enables web browsers to do something more than just 
    displaying static results. Scripts are used in web design to 
    create dynamic pages.

  - title: Script tag
    description: >
      If HTML is the sructure of your page and CSS the styling, scripts allow
      for behaviour. To add behaviour you create a script tag and inside most
      commonly JavaScript is used. JavaScript works by finding a target HTML
      element, and then doing something to it, just like CSS, but the way it 
      operates, the syntax etc. is rather different.
    instructions:
      - Add the script tag
      - Target an element to use in script

    description: >
      When your polymer-element does not contain a script you should always
      explicitly mention this by adding the noscript attribute, otherwise it
      will not work. In Polymer the script should always be included in the element it refers to.
      The reason is to keep the element encapsulated. 
    instructions:
      - Look at the code of rijksmuseum-query.html and index.html
      - Make the page display artworks of your favorite painter and their titles using the repeat attribute of Polymer
      - (Hint':' 'look in the Javascript console in your browser)
