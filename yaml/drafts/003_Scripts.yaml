    A script is a small bit of code that enables web browsers to do something 
    more than just displaying static results. Scripts are used in web design to 
    create dynamic pages. So far you have included noscript inside your polymer 
    element. The reason is because untill now we did not use the script 
    functionalities. There are some big differences between regular HTML scripts 
    and Polymer scripts.

    description: >
      HTML specifies the strucutre, CSS the styling, scripts allow
      for behaviour. To add behaviour you create a script tag and inside most
      commonly JavaScript is used. JavaScript works by finding a target HTML
      element, and then doing something to it, just like CSS, but he syntax is 
      different.
    instructions:
      - Open the plunker file in the resources and press run
      - Add the script tag
      - Inside the script tag target the blockquote by using its ID
      - Change the background color of the element using a script
      - The font of the author is too small make it bigger using a script

  - title: Set up a Script in Polymer
    description: >
      Now you know how to use scripts in regular HTML but we want to
      use Polymer. Polymer always requires a script. When you do not include a 
      script, you need to explicitly tell Polymer by adding the noscript 
      attribute. In Polymer the syntax to include a script is different.
      Till now all the Polymer elements included this noscript.
      This time we add the basic syntax to include a script inside your Polymer 
      component.
    instructions:
      - open the plunker file
      - look at the basic script set up syntax
      - remove the no script to start using the script
      - >You do not have to include a script try to understand the syntax needed
        to allow the script to work

  - title: Create Scripts with Polymer
    description: >
      In this case we will use the script to set our values, and we will use
      the double bracket method (like handlebars) to insert those values 
      elsewhere. This is a slightly different method than targeting the ID. 
      The reason for doing this is because in Polymer we do not have to 
      target the element because our element containing the script already 
      indicates where we want our script to run. In Polymer we can only use 
      functions and objects inside the script tag, they may seem complicated 
      but for now accept the syntax the way it is. Instead of document. we
      use this. because this again references to the element itself.
    instructions:
      - Open the plunker file
      - Look at all the values that are set inside the script tag
      - > The values that are set contain content try to find where that content 
        is transferred to using the double brackets
      - > There is also a function starting with ready, by adding ready it will 
        only run once the DOM is ready for JavaScript code to execute.
      - > The function sets a value to backgroundColor use the double brackets
        to transfer this value to the appropriate place in the style tag
      - The font of the author is too small make it bigger using a script
