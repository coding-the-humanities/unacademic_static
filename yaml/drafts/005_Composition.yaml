    The design...

    Object-Oriented Programing has too well known candidates for the 
    reuse of functionality. 
    Inheritance is tree structure each object inherits all information
    from the higher. From specific to more general. Composition from generic to
    specific. composed of many objects that make out the bigger objects.

    Nobody wants to repeat themselves so to save us 
    time these theoretical frameworks were constructed to provide us with a
    solution to his problem. 
    Composition addresses the problem of repeating code by providing a solution
    to reuse your code in an effective way.
    Composition is a mechanism for forming an 
    object whole using other objects as its parts. It reduces complexity by 
    treating many objects as one object.

    Inheritance (whitebox reuse) and Composition 
    (blackbox reuse). If you try to reuse code by inheriting from a class you 
    will make the subclass dependent on the parent class. This makes a system 
    in many cases unnecessarily complex, less testable

    take a new thing and takes over all of the properties of the old thing inheritance
    retain all of the old behaviour, is the same thing with more stuff, this is an extended version of this

tasks: Composition vs Inheritance
       Composition is defined as a relationship that associates a whole and its parts,
       no tree hierarchy makes it easier to swap and change
       inheritance reuses implementation and establishes a syntactic relationship
       composition relates to the philosophy of polymer.
