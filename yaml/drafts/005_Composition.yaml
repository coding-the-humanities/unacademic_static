    Composition is a method programmers use to design their code.
    Code can be a hotchpotch of meaningless words and numbers.
    When we think of maintaibality, scalability and the ease for collaboration. 
    You might want to structure your code in a more efficient way. 

    Composition is one of these structure methods to provide us with a
    solution to optimize functionality reuse.
    It builds on the ideas of Object-Oriented-programming or simply OOP.

    In this lesson you will familiarise yourself with these fundamentals
    of structuring snd designing code.

  summary: >
    Composition is a method to structure your code to optimize code reuse.

    description: >
      Object-oriented programming, also called OOP, is a model for writing 
      computer programs. Before OOP most programs were a list of instructions 
      that acted on memory in the computer. Instead of a procedural list of 
      actions, OOP is modeled around objects that interact with each other. 
      Classes generate objects and define their structure, like a blueprint. 
      The objects interact with each other to carry out the intent of the 
      computer program.

  - title: Discover the benefits of Composition over Inheritance
    description: >
      Object-Oriented Programing has too well known candidates for the 
      reuse of functionality. Inheritance and Composition
      Inheritance is like a tree structure each object inherits all information
      from the higher class in the tree. Think of it from specific to more general. 
      Inheritance is quicker to set up but might produce problems down the line, for 
      example when you have to make a change to the highest class in the tree structure.
      A problem like that would influence all the other objects connected and create some
      unwanted results.
      Composition is a method where the big objects ar composed of smaller objects, each
      serving a different smaller function. this method reduces complexity by 
      treating many objects as one object.
