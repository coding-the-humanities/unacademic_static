    Just like organisms have a certain lifecycle, webcomponents have a 
    lifecycle of their own. For example: an element can be generated
    in your browser (DOM). It's attributes can be changed, or it can be 
    detached from the DOM. By using Javascript we can tap into this
    lifecycle and add a certain amount of interactivity (lifecycle callback).
    For instance, you could make a loading screen by using this principle: One 
    of the first things we load into the DOM is a big component which covers 
    the whole screen (the loading page). Once the DOM is fully initiliazed we
    simply remove/detach this element from the DOM.
    [Misschien ander voorbeeld dan loading screen gebruiken omdat ik dit ook al als opdracht gebruik]

  - title: Get to know the lifecycles
    description: >
      The official W3C webcomponent specification defines four different lifecycles. 
      Polymer has the same lifecycles, but gives them different names and further
      specifies some of the lifecycles.  
    instructions:
      - Have a look at Polymer's lifecycle
      - You could also take a look at W3C's specifications, but beware, it does get into some technical details

  - title: Design a loading screen
    description: >
      One way you could use an element lifecycle is by designing
      a loading screen. For instance: the element that contains the
      the loading screen can be the first element that is put
      into the page. Once the DOM has finished loading we simply
      remove this element.
    instructions:
      - Use the Polymer documentation to find a lifecycle that fits this purpose
      - Insert this lifecycle method into the Plunker script
