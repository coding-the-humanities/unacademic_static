    Most of the JSON files we've been looking into so far have been pretty 
    complex. It usually takes quite some time to wrap your head around them, and
    the same applies for most of the other data formats we encounter. However,
    there are ways to interpret the data more easily, and to make them accessible 
    for a broader audience. One way we could do this is by data visualization.
    As the name implies it is basically the visual interpretation of data. You
    could visualize the data as bars, charts, lines etcetera. However the more
    advanced data visualizations go well beyond the point of simple lines and
    bar charts. In this objective you will have a quick introduction to the basics 
    of data visualization, and you will make a bar chart by using the Rijksmuseum
    API.
