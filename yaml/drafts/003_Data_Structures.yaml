    Data comes in many forms, and data structures equally so.
    But as terrifying as arrays and objects might seem at first glance,
    they're easy to grasp in reality.
    Variables and data are used in all programming languages (and one could
    even say in natural languages).
    The ways they are and can be structured vary from language to language,
    but usually values are put in lists and lists within lists.

  - title: Variables
    description: >
      Variables are the smallest particles of data you can manipulate
      with Javascript. They can be numbers, letters, true or false statements
      (booleans) and also arrays (lists).
      Variables are declared by putting 'var' in front of a word that
      is just a name for the thing inside.

  - title: Strings
    description: >
      Strings are essentially a number of characters glued together.
      Strings can form words, sentences, URL's; basically anything.
      One important aspect of strings is that they are arrays,
      and like arrays they index at zero.
      Quotes ("") denote strings.

  - title: Arrays
    description: >
      Arrays are lists of data.
      Some only contain numbers, some contain characters.
      While strings are arrays, arrays may contain multiple strings.
      Arrays may even contain multiple arrays!
      The [] brackets are used to indicate arrays.

  - title: Objects
    description: >
      Objects are slightly more intricate than arrays,
      but only slightly so. 
      Whereas arrays are simply lists, objects are lists
      with keys.
      These keys are words under which values are files.
      A quick example would look like this: {name: "Katherine Janeway"};.
