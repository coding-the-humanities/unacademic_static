    Data comes in many forms, and data structures equally so.
    But as terrifying as arrays and objects might seem at first glance,
    they're easy to grasp in reality.
    Variables and data are used in all programming languages (and one could
    even say in natural languages).
    The ways they are and can be structured vary from language to language,
    but usually values are put in lists and lists within lists.

    description: >
      Variables are the smallest particles of data you can manipulate
      with Javascript. They can be numbers, letters, true or false statements
      (booleans) and also arrays (lists).
      Variables are declared by putting 'var' in front of a word that
      is just a name for the thing inside.

  - title: Strings
    description: >
      Strings are essentially a number of characters glued together.
      Strings can form words, sentences, URL's; basically anything.
      One important aspect of strings is that they are arrays,
      and like arrays they index at zero.
      Quotes ("") denote strings.
      The objective is to manipulate strings into doing what you want,
      by writing a little program.
    instructions:
      - Read the article
      - Copy and paste the article (or any other text) into one long string
        in your text editor
      - Change all characters to lower case
      - Make another string, this time of your name
      - Using a number of for loops and if statements,
        capitalise letters in the long text so that it shows your name over and
        over again
      - If you get confused, take a look at the Arrays objective first

  - title: Arrays
    description: >
      Arrays are lists of data.
      Some only contain numbers, some contain characters.
      While strings are arrays, arrays may contain multiple strings.
      Arrays may even contain multiple arrays!
      The [] brackets are used to indicate arrays.
    instructions:
      - Read the article
      - Make an array containing the titles of five of your favorite books,
        movies, series or albums/songs
      - Add a title once using the push method, once using the unshift method,
        and once using a different method
      - Remove a title three times using different methods each time

  - title: Objects
    description: >
      Objects are slightly more intricate than arrays,
      but only slightly so. 
      Whereas arrays are simply lists, objects are lists
      with keys.
      These keys are words under which values are files.
      A quick example would look like this: {name: "Katherine Janeway"};.
      One fun aspect of Javascript is that virtually everything
      is an object.
    instructions:
      - Read the articles
      - Make an object containing the titles of five of your favorite books,
        movies, series or albums/songs using the creators as keys and the titles
        as values
      - Expand the object by making objects within the object for every key,
        adding subkeys and values for creator, title, year, and the reason
        why you think this particular artwork is so awesome
