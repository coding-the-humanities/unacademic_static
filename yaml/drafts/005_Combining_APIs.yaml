    description: >
      Mashing up is the principle of taking the data of two or more API's
      or datasets and combining these to create something new.
      Usually this is achieved by taking data and juxtapositioning it with
      other data in such a way that a surprising and interesting effect is
      achieved.
      For example, Wheel of Lunch takes a location and what you want to eat
      and randomly selects a place in your vicinity where you can get that food.
      It does so by consulting the Yahoo Local Search API.
      Sadly, it told us to get our sushi at the Albert Heijn, so it's not 
      entirely flawless.
      This is just one of the many things that can be achieved with mashing up.
