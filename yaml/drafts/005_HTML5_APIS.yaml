  HTML5 provides a serie of APIs that help in creating web applications. For
  example, with a few lines of code you can request the users geolocation. You 
  can play videos or audio natively, without using any external plugins such as 
  Adobe Flash or Apple Quicktime. In this objective you will have a quick 
  overview of all the different HTML5 APIs, and you will make use of two very 
  interesting APIs: namely geo location and the audio element API.

  - title: Meet all the different HTML5 APIs
    description: >
      HTML5 introduced a lot of APIs. Some of them are more useful than others. Have a
      quick look at the official W3C documentation. Maybe you can find an API that
      you can use for your own group project.
    instructions:
      - Have a look at the official HTML5 API documentation

  - title: Find your own location
    description: >
      One of the most interesting HTML5 API's is the geo location API. The geo location
      API enables you to find the geo location of the users his computer. The OECD 
      Regional Wellbeing uses this feature to automatically compare the users country 
      with other countries. At the Plunker you will see how this feature is being 
      implemented in Polymer. In the combining APIs objective you will combine this 
      component with the Rijksmuseum API.
    instructions:
      - Look at how the OECD implents this API
      - Have a good look at the Plunker

  - title: Play some audio or video
    description: >
      Another cool API is the video and audio element. As you might remember from your 
      own childhood memories, playing sound or video has been possible for quite some time.
      However it always required the user to have external plugins installed (such as Flash,
      RealPlayer or Quicktime). This API is supported natively by browsers, and therefore
      enables you to get really creative. The Sound City Project is a really neat example.
      It uses 3d soundmapping technology to create an almost life-like experience. Videos
      are often used as full-screen backgrounds.
