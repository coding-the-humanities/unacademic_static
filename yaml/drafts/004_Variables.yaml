    Variables are containers for data,and like many other containers 
    they are often labelled with a name.
    Because confusing H2O with H2O2 by mistake will most likely kill you, 
    it is usefull to label your containers so that you have a good idea
    what is inside. 
    In this case: "water" and "hydrogen peroxide" would be apt container names.

    Variables are what drive programs.

  - title: Math
    description: >
      For most humanities students math is a scary word,
      but computers are actually particularly suited for
      mathematical jobs.
      In other words; your computer makes math less scary.
      Simple mathematical operations are the usual 
      addition (+), substraction (-), division (/)
      and multiplication (*).
      More complex operations can be performed with
      the so called Math object.

  - title: Scope
    description: >
      Scope is the concept of where variables can be accessed.
      For example, a variable that is declared within a function
      cannot really be accessed from the outside.
      However, a variable outside a function can be accessed
      from within the function.
      Scope is very important to keep in mind,
      because faulty scoping can mess up any program.

  - title: Var and Let
    description: >
      In the new Javascript there are two different types
      of variables. 
      Var is the one mostly used, let is the new one.
      Chances are you will seldomly to never use the latter.
      Let is a special type of variable that can only be accessed
      in the code block where it is declared in.
      Because this is such a new technology, this task is not
      mandatory at all. 
      It simply lets you get a closer look at the principle of
      scope.
