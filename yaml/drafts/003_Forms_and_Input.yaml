   We regularly come across fields on a website used to collect 
   user input, like names, surnames, checkbox answers or buttons. This bundle of 
   features on a website is collectively called a form. A form consists of 
   different form elements called input elements which in their turn have 
   numerous different types. So, a form can have for instance three input 
   elements: two with type "text" for name and surname and one third with type 
   "submit"; the well known submit button.
  summary: > 
   Forms are used to collect user input, like names, surnames, selected answers 
   or messages.
