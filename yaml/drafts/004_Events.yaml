    All interactions users have on a web page are essentially events. Events are 
    triggered by the user when for example clicking with the mouse on an 
    image or pressing a key. So, an event happens when you visit a web page and 
    this page has just finished loading, when you decide to click on the button 
    of an HTML form or just when you close a web page. An event is a 
    notification that an action has taken place; this notification triggers a 
    script, which in turn executes a function. These scripts, each associated 
    with a specific type of event, are called event handlers.

    description: >
        An action triggers an event; an event calls an event handler; 
        an event handler executes a script; a script runs functions.
        Event handlers are simple scripts that call certain functions
        For example, the onload event handler can trigger 
        - the often hated - pop-up windows when the page you have just 
        visited finished loading.
