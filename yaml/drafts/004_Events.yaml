    All interactions users have on a web page are essentially events. Events are 
    triggered by the user when for example clicking with the mouse on an 
    image or pressing a key. So, an event happens when you are visiting a web 
    page and then decide to click on (something) or just resize the page. An event
    is a notification that something has taken place, and this notification 
    message then triggers a script and this script executes a function.
