   We regularly come across fields on web pages used to collect 
   user input, like names, e-mail addresses, checkbox answers or messages. 
   This bundle of features on a website is a form. A form consists of
   different form elements called controls or widgets. Controls are usually defined 
   by input elements which in their turn have numerous different types. So, a 
   form can have for instance three input elements: one with type "text" for 
   name, another one with type "email" for e-mail address and one third with 
   type "submit"; the well known submit button.
  summary: > 
   Forms are used to collect user input, like names, e-mail addresses, selected 
   answers or messages.
