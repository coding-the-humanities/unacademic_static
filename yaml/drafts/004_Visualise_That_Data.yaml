    description: >
      This graph will be based on the life and work of Rembrandt van Rijn
      and must have two parameters; location and quantity of works. So, 
      the graph will actually answer the question in which location did Rembrandt
      produced most of his works. The Plunker file below contains everything you
      need to complete the assignment. 
    instructions:
      - Fork the Plunker code below
      - Add all the correct paramaters to the component
      - Hit Run to see if your code works
