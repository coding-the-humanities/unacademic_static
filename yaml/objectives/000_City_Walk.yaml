    You must be anxious to dive into the wonderful world of web programming.
    But the first thing we want you to do has sadly / luckily nothing to do with code.
    You must go out in the city of Amsterdam and follow one of the two routes below.
    If you want you can also follow both routes, but that's up to you.
    While you are taking your walk, take as many pictures as you like
    of things you think are interesting. The purpose of this odd request is to encourage you to make content,
    which you are going to use in this and later assignments.
