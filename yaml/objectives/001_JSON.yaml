    instructions:
      - >

        Get a feel for the syntax by creating a meta-data set for your photos. 
        It should be an array of objects(the photos) with the name of the

  - title: Linting data
    description: >
      You will come across and make syntax errors, probably more often than you 
      would expect. A good way to fix these errors is to use a linter to scan 
      your code.
    instructions:
      - Try to check the linting task in the resources manually. Or...

  - title: Structuring your data
    description: >
      You now have syntactically correct data. But you are not there yet. 
      If the data isn't repetitive in some way, or keys are written differently 
      from item to item, it will still be of no use. What are the important 
      things you have to keep track of?
    instructions:
      - Fix the inconsistencies in this file
      - Pay attention to things like nesting and repetition.
      - >
        Look back at your own file, is it well structured? 
        Make sure that every photo's properties are grouped!
