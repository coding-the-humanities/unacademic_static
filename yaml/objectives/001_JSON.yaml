    JSON is a dataformat that you will not quickly get rid of. It is everywhere.
    Many API's supply you with this data. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation. 
    But it is not exclusivly Javascript. Many other languages have support for it.

    description: >
      JSON is build on two important notions. Key/Value pairs and unordered lists.
    instructions:
      - Find out what Key/Value pairs are and their relation to unordered lists.
      - Get a feel for the syntax by creating a data set with ...

  - title: Linting data
    description: >
      You will make or encounter syntax errors, probably more often than you'd 
      like. A good way to fix syntax errors is by using a linter check for 
      syntax errors.
    instructions:
      - Try to check this file ... manually. Or...

  - title: Structuring your data
    description: >
      So you have syntactically correct data. Who cares? If the data isn't
      repetative in some way, or keys are written differently from item to item 
      it's still not of any use to anyone. What things are important to keep 
      track of?
    instruction:
      - Fix the inconsistencies in this file
      - Pay attention to things like nesting and repetition. 

  - title: Importing data
    description: >
      With the creation of a nice dataset the next step is to get it into the
      app you are developing. In web applications this is often done using an
      AJAX call. Asynchronous Javascript + XML. Normal javascript code excecution 
      is done synchronous. Which means that the code waits for the previous 
      request to finish. But if you have a rather large dataset, you often don't 
      want it to stop everything else. AJAX to the rescue. 
    instruction:
      - make an AJAX call to your constructed dataset
