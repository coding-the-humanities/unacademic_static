  full: >
    JSON is a data format you will encounter very often since it is almost 
    everywhere. Many API's supply you with data in this format. It stands for 
    JavaScript Object Notation, but it is not exclusively Javascript. Many other 
    languages support it as well.

  - title: Discovering JSON
    description: >
      JSON is built on two important notions, namely Key/Value pairs and 
      unordered lists.
    instructions:
      - Find out what Key/Value pairs are and what their relation is to unordered 
        lists.
      - Get a feel for the syntax by creating a meta-data set for you photos. 
        This should include the name of the photographer, url, location and a 
        summary.
    resources:

        site:
          name:  JSON
        url:     http://www.json.org/

  - title: Linting data
    description: >
      You will come across and make syntax errors, probably more often than you 
      would expect. A good way to fix these errors is to use a linter to scan 
      your code.
    instructions:
      - Try to check this file ... manually. Or...

  - title: Structuring your data
    description: >
      You now have syntactically correct data. But you are not there yet. 
      If the data isn't repetitive in some way, or keys are written differently 
      from item to item, it will still be of no use. What are the important 
      things you have to keep track of?
    instruction:
      - Fix the inconsistencies in this file ...
      - Pay attention to things like nesting and repetition. 

  - title: Importing data
    description: >
      After creating a satisfactory dataset, the next step is to integrate it 
      into the app you are developing. In web applications this is often done 
      using an AJAX call, which stands for Asynchronous Javascript + XML. Any 
      resemblance to Trojan war heroes or football teams is purely coincidental. 
      Normal javascript code execution is done synchronously, meaning the code 
      waits for the previous request to conclude before a new one begins. But if 
      you have a large dataset, this process would cause too much delay. So,
      AJAX comes to the rescue.
    instruction:
      - make an AJAX call to your constructed dataset
