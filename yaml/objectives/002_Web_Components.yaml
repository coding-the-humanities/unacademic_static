    Web Components are the future of web development, but what are they? 
    Remeber the <img> element, that allows you to embed an image to your 
    website? What if you could create your own custom element. For example 
    we could create an element called <my-clock> that would insert a clock 
    displaying the time. Like any other element we could then reuse our 
    clock element whenever and wherever we need. This is exactly what 
    web components allow us to do, to create custom HTML elements. 
    Web components enable truly encapsulated and reusable components for
    the web. This means we can easily create widgets and other useful
    elements that can be easily shared, without having to retype or 
    rework code. That is the beauty of web components.

  - title: Familiarise yourself with Polymer
    description: >
      Polymer is a library build on top of web components making the 
      development of web components easier. Polymer has a certain way 
      of thinking how these web components are best used and created. 
      First familiarise yourself with Polymer and its methodology. 
      Check out the website and the introduction video.
    instructions:
      - Read up on Polymer on the website
      - Watch the introduction video by Matthew McNulty

  -title:  Relay information between Polymer elements
      description: >
        You are about to build your first Polymer elements; keep in mind that you
        also have to make these elements communicate with one another in order 
        to get your code actually working. You will learn how to call and connect 
        your elements with one another, and how to exchange information using 
        so-called attributes.
      instructions: 
        - Go to the Plunker link below. Fork the code to create your own elements.
        - Link them to the index page as shown in the hello-page example. 
        - Define and use your own custom attributes in your elements.
        - Hit Run to see what it looks like.
        - Use the references below to elaborate on your code.
