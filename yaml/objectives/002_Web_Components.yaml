    Web components are the future of web development, but what are they? 
    Remeber the <img> element, that allows you to embed an image to your 
    website? What if you could create your own custom element. For example 
    we could create an element called <my-clock> that would insert a clock 
    displaying the time. Like any other element we could then reuse our 
    clock element whenever and wherever we need. This is exactly what 
    web components allow us to do, to create custom HTML elements. 
    Web components enable truly encapsulated and reusable components for
    the web. This means we can easily create widgets and other useful
    elements that can be easily shared, without having to retype or 
    rework code. That is the beauty of web components.

  - title: Familiarise yourself with Polymer
    description: >
      Polymer is a library built on top of web components making the 
      development of web components easier. Polymer has a certain way 
      of thinking how these web components are best used and created. 
      First familiarise yourself with Polymer and its methodology. 
      Check out the website and the introduction video.
    instructions:
      - Read up on Polymer on the Polymer Project website
      - Watch the introduction video by Matthew McNulty (link below)
      - Click on the Plunker link and fork the posted code
      - Make your own Polymer element as shown in the example
