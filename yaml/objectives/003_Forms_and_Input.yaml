   We regularly come across fields on a website used to collect 
   user input, like name, surname, a checkbox or a button. These certain features 
   on a website are collectively called a form. A form consists of different 
   form elements called input which in its turn has numerous different types. So, 
   a form can have for instance three input elements: two with type "text" for 
   name and surname and one third with type "submit"; the well known submit 
   button.
