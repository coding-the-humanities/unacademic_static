    A very important tool to know is the DevTools in your browser. It is used for
    many things like bugtesting or experimenting. You can also use it to see
    things like the perfomance of the site. You can view your html, css and script
    combined, and you can actively interact with it. Google has a very nice
    implementation of these, which is one of the reasons we use chrome as a
    browser.

  - title: Changing CSS in DevTools
    description: >
      DevTools are a great way to test out some css and see it rendered right
      away. Often you will run into styling not showing up because you made a
      little syntax error. The console allows you to quickly change a bunch of
      things.

      - Change or add a few CSS values
      - Experiment a bit with the box-model

  - title: Using the Javascript Console
    description: >
      The console is a useful tool to test out little bits of code in
      conjuntion with your site. You can test very simple commands or do complex
      debugging. Your website can output to the console. If you for instance add
      a console.log("hello"), it will show up here.
    instructions:
      - Do some basic calculations in the console (for instance: 1+1)
      - Try console.log("something")
      - Create a simple variable (type - var name = "Your Name")
        (and call it with - name)
