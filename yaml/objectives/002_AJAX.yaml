    AJAX is not a separate programming language, but more a collection of techniques derived 
    from Javascript and XML (a language similar to HTML). 
    It allows programmers to perform a bunch of operations, most notable is retrieving information or
    'querying' a database or an API.
  summary: >
    AJAX allows you to retrieve information from external sources.

      It is a bit of work to write a wrapper for an API. 
      So we wrote one for you to play with.
      Clone it from Github, or download the zip folder.
    instructions:
      - Download the project
      - Using the node.js console, go to the folder and type 'static'
      - If it doesn't work, run 'npm install -g bower node-static' and try again
      - Go to localhost:8080 in your browser. You should see a nifty little message.

      Sadly, the project is not finished yet.
      As doing something is the best way to learn something,
      you will finish this project by making it display artworks
      by your favorite artist. 
      Currently it searches for artworks by Jan Steen, but you are
      more than encouraged to change this.
    instructions:
      - Look at the code of rijksmuseum-query.html and index.html
      - Make the page display the artworks and their titles 
        using the repeat attribute of Polymer
      - (Hint: look in the Javascript console in your browser)
