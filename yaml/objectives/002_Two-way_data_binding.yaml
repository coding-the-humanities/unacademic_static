    In the previous level you did a task on templating. On Plunker, the page 
    automatically reloads everytime you make a change; on a real web application 
    though this is not a desirable behaviour. By using two-way data binding the 
    DOM element changes when the data is changed and vice versa.

  - title: Relay information between Polymer elements
    description: >
      You have already built a Polymer element. You now have to make these 
      elements communicate with one another in order to get your code 
      to actually work. You will learn how to call and connect your elements, 
      and how to exchange information between elements using so-called attributes.
    instructions: 
      - Go to the Plunker link below, fork the code and create your own element
      - Link them to the index page as shown with the hello-page example
      - Define and use your own custom attributes in your elements
      - Hit Run to see what it looks like
      - Use the resources below to elaborate on your code
