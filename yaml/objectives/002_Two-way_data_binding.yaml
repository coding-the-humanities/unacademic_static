- title: Relay information between Polymer elements
    description: >
      You have already built a Polymer element. You now have to make these 
      elements communicate with one another in order to get your code 
      to actually work. You will learn how to call and connect your elements, 
      and how to exchange information between elements using so-called attributes.
    instructions: 
      - Go to the Plunker link below, fork the code and create your own elements
      - Link them to the index page as shown with the hello-page example
      - Define and use your own custom attributes in your elements
      - Hit Run to see what it looks like
      - Use the resources below to elaborate on your code
