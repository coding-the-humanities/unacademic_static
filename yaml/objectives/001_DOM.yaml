    The DOM -Document Object Model - is an interface for HTML
    documents. It defines the structure of a document and uses document, text,
    element and attribute nodes to represent and interact with objects. This
    allows for programming languages to interact with web pages. These nodes
    have hierarchical relations to one another -root, parents, children, siblings.
    So, in a visual representation of a DOM you see the so-called node tree.
