    The DOM -Document Object Model - is actually the representation of an HTML 
    document structure. In the DOM you can see the various objects of a page and 
    how they relate to each other; through the DOM you can interact with these. 
    The structure of the DOM looks like a tree with the different objects shown
    as branches.
