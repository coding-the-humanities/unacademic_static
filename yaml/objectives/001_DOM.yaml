    The DOM -Document Object Model - is actually the representation of an HTML 
    document structure. In the DOM you can see the various objects of a page and 
    how they relate to each other; through the DOM you can interact with these. 
    The structure of the DOM looks like a tree with the different objects shown
    as branches.

  - title: Types of Nodes
    description: >
      There are four types of nodes. The document, element, attribute and text 
      node. They cleary relate to the HTML, especially element nodes; an image 
      tag is an example of this. These element nodes have attributes nodes like 
      classes for instance. And then there is the content, which is within the 
      text node. The document node wraps the entire structure. The DevTools can 
      help understand how these elements are represented.
    instructions:
      - Open the javascript console in your browser.
      - Type console.log(document) in the javascript console. This will show 
        something very similar to the HTML structure. 
      - It is not quite the same though. If you type console.dir(document) you can
        now clearly see the differences.
      - Get to know the object

  - title: Relation between Nodes
    description: >
      Elements in the DOM are related to each other in a tree structure. Every 
      element has a parent and can have children and siblings. These are 
      very important relationships. They make it easier to select items when you 
      don't know their exact name or, or can help you avoid giving classes to 
      every element you see. It is also the reason we indent the tags in our
      document. It would be otherwise impossible to see the tree structure.
    instructions:
      - Try to fix the indentation on the Plunker link below.
      - Navigate the document object keeping these terms in mind and see 
        how they are applied.

  - title: Interaction with the DOM trough CSS 
    description: >
      One of the tools you've already used to interact with the DOM is CSS.
      Probably you've done this trough classes (an attribute node). CSS however
      lets you interact with the DOM in many ways. You can also navigate the DOM
      with the relationships.
    instruction:
      - Target elements using the css child and type selectors.
      - Look at your document, are there classes that could be replace by 
        selecting the element node?
      - Could you replace classes with (first/last/nth) child selectors?

  - title: Interaction with the DOM trough Javascript
    description: >
      The DOM functions as a programming interface to interact with your 
      document. It allows you to change the document instantly. In the previous 
      task styling was attached to elements with CSS, but nothing changed 
      actually. Elements can be changed using Javascript. Try this out with the 
      instructions below.
    instructions:
      - Go to the page of the first task on the Mozilla Developer Network
      - Open your DevTools, type in the command below and see what happens
      - document.getElementById("main-header").innerHTML = "Hello"
      - Try moving the phrase to another place on the page
