    The DOM -Document Object Model - is actually the representation of an HTML 
    document structure. In the DOM you can see the various objects of a page and 
    how they relate to each other; through the DOM you can interact with these. 
    The structure of the DOM looks like a tree with the different objects shown
    as branches.

  - title: Types of Nodes
    description: >
      There are four types of nodes. The document, element, attribute and text node.
      They cleary relate to the HTML. Especially element nodes relate clearly to 
      the HTML, an image tag is an example of this. These element node have 
      attributes node like a class. And of course the content, within the text 
      node. The document node wraps the entire thing. To clearly understand 
      these elements are represented the devTools are really helpful.
    instructions:
      - Open the javascript console in your browser.
      - Type console.log(document) in the javascript console. This is going to
        something very comparable to HTML structure. 
      - But not quite the same.. If you type console.dir(document) you can
        now clearly see what is different. 
      - Get to know the object a bit.

  - title: Relation between Nodes
    description: >
      Elements in the DOM are related to each other in a tree structure. Every 
      element has an parent and could have children and siblings. These are 
      very important relationships. They make it easier to select items when you 
      don't know their name exactly or, or can help you avoid giving classes to 
      every element you see. It is also the reason we indent the tags in our
      document. Screwing that up will make it next to impossible to see the tree
      structure. 
    instructions:
      - Try and fix the indentation in this file.
      - Try and navigate document object with these terms in mind and see how 
        they are applied.

  - title: Interaction with the DOM trough CSS 
    description: >
      One of the tools you've already used to interact with the DOM is CSS.
      Probably you've done this trough classes (an attribute node). CSS however
      lets you interact with the DOM in many ways. You can also navigate the DOM
      with the relationships.
    instruction:
      - Target elements using the css child and type selectors.
      - Look at your document, are there classes that could be replace by 
        selecting the element node?
      - Could you replace classes with (first/last/nth) child selectors?

  - title: Interaction with the DOM trough Javascript
    description: >
      The DOM functions as an programming interface to interact with your 
      document. It allows you to change the document on the fly. A moment ago we
      attached styling to elements with CSS, but we didn't actually change anything.
      To implement behaviour like that we have Javascript. Try changing some
      elements with the instructions below.
    instructions:
      - Go to the page of the first task on the Mozilla Developer Network
      - Open your DevTools, type in the command below and see what happens
      - document.getElementById("main-header").innerHTML = "Hello"
      - Try moving the phrase to another place on the page
