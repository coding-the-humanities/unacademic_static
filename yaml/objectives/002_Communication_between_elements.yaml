- title: Relay information between Polymer elements
    description: >
      You are about to build your first Polymer elements. Keep in mind that you
      have to make these elements communicate with one another in order 
      to get your code to actually work. You will learn how to call and connect 
      your elements, and how to exchange information between elements 
      using so-called attributes.
    instructions: 
      - Go to the Plunker link below, fork the code and create your own elements
      - Link them to the index page as shown with the hello-page example
      - Define and use your own custom attributes in your elements
      - Hit Run to see what it looks like
      - Use the resources below to elaborate on your code
