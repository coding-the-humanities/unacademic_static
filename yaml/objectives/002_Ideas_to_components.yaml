    Now you came up with tons of ideas on how to implement the Rijksmuseum API, 
    it's time to put one of those ideas in a real webcomponent.
    It could be anything: switches, knobs, an image viewer etc. Your project group's
    only limitation is it's own technical capabilities.

      But first you should try to get all your ideas on paper. Try to design
      your application on paper or make a wireframe by using a digital tool such as Moqups. 
      Try to break down your concept in multiple components. Think clearly about
      their structure, and how the user interacts with each component.
    instructions:
      - Either use pen and paper or use a digital tool to make a wireframe out of your concept.

  - title: Pick one component
    description: >
      Once you're group has finished drawing a wireframe, it's time too choose a component.
      Which component would be best suitable for a component? Try to further specify this component.
      How does the user interact with it? Which features are essential, and which ones are less important?
