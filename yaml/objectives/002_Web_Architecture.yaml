    When a web page is rendered inside your browser, data is being transmitted. 
    The information needed to render the page is stored on the server. 
    In order to get that information your browser needs to request that information. 
    These request are called http requests and they are the foundation for any web application. 
    Http requests make it possible to communicate and transfer data. This communication between 
    client (your browser) and server is what happens when you click a button and the page 
    changes a new request is send. But what if we want to just change a little piece of our website.
    Whenever you want to show a change on the page, we need to send an http request to refresh te 
    entire page, even if we just want to change one little piece of it. If we would have a widget 
    that needs to update regularly this would make the use of the site impossible. 
    Having to wait for everything. This is where Ajax comes in. Ajax is a method
    to communicate with a server in the background, without interfering with the current state of the page. 
    This technique is what makes modern web apps possible.

    description: >
      Ajax is a group of interrelated web development techniques used on the client-side to 
      communicate with the server in the background. Ajax works on the client side meaning 
      your browser. If you take a look at the infographic you can see this concept visualised, 
      the Ajax engine is nested inside the browser. The infographic is the best way to understanding
      the difference between the traditional (rerendering entire page) and the Ajax method.

  - title: Ajax and Polymer
    description: >
      Polymer has a really nice way to handle Ajax requests; core-ajax. 
      This component allows programmers to easily query API's and manipulate that data.
      But that's not all, because it is just another polymer element!
      Take a look at the following Plunker link.
      It's not done yet, but it's up to you to finish it.
    instructions:
      - Look at the code of rijksmuseum-query.html and index.html
      - Make the page display artworks of your favorite painter and 
        their titles using the repeat attribute of Polymer
      - (Hint: look in the Javascript console in your browser)
