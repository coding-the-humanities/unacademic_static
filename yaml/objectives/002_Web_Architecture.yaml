    When a web page is rendered inside your browser, data is being transmitted. 
    The information needed to render the page is stored on the server and in order to retrieve 
    the browser needs to request that information. These request are called http requests 
    and they are the foundation for any web application. Whenever you want to show a change 
    on the page, we need to send an http request to refresh the entire page, even if we just want to 
    change one little piece of it. If we would have a widget 
    that needs to update regularly this would make the use of the site impossible. 
    Having to wait for everything. This is where Ajax comes in. Ajax is a method
    to communicate with a server in the background, without interfering with the current state of the page. 
    This technique is what makes modern web apps possible.

  - title: Familiarise with Ajax
    description: >
      Ajax is a group of interrelated web development techniques used on the client-side to 
      communicate with the server that runs in the background. Ajax works on the client side meaning:  
      your browser. The Ajax engine is nested inside the browser. Visual representation is probably 
      a good way to grasp the difference between the traditional (rerendering entire page) and the Ajax method.
    instructions:
      - Look at the infographic the link you can find below
      - Read the resources below to get an understanding of what Ajax entails

  - title: Combine Ajax and Polymer
    description: >
      Polymer has a really nice way to handle Ajax requests; it's called core-ajax. 
      This component allows programmers to easily query API's and manipulate that data.
      But that's not all, because it is just another polymer element!
      Take a look at the Plunker link below. It's not done yet, but it's up to you 
      to finish it.
    instructions:
      - Look at the code of rijksmuseum-query.html and index.html
      - Make the page display artworks of your favorite painter and their titles using the repeat attribute of Polymer
      - '(Hint: look in the Javascript console in your browser)'
