    In web development some key principles proved to be very important. When starting
    a project, things start to get complicated fast. That is why we must consider maintainability.
    A project should also be able to grow for example adding new features or ellaborating on existing 
    ones, this is called scalability. In order to collaborate, a team should be able to easily share
    their work. Webcomponents is one possible anwser to these problems, because they allow easy 
    implementation of features by simply importing them, keeping clean and readable code. 
    With scalabality in mind, components can be combined, stacked or replaced. And most importantly 
    because components are completely encapsulated it provides an easy way to share and reuse code.
    Working with Webcomponents is not only about creating your own custom elements but also how to
    incorporate other people's custom elements. Why create something that has already been created.
    Instead of just collaborating with your team why not share your components with the world?
    This idea resulted in an active community sharing their components. There are many components available
    one could build an entire web app just from external components.

      Polymer already provides many standardized custom elements that are useful for building your own
      web app. These components are designed to be like building blocks, you can mix and match and add your own.
      These components are a great way to get started with building a web app of your own. To help you
      visualise the way these components work together, Polymer has created a web tool called designer.
      In designer you can choose from all the web components Polymer has to offer and drag and drop
      them on the canvas.
    instructions:
      - Have a look at all the components out there
      - Open the Polymer Designer and start combining some components

      Google provides web developpers with tools to incorporate google services on their website.
      For example to incorporate google maps, you need to do quite a bit of work to get it working.
      This includes creating mark up, scripts and communicating with their API. These are steps one 
      have to take everytime they need to incorporate google maps, besides these steps always remain
      the same. With the google maps custom element this process is simplified. You can import the 
      element with a single line. You can then use it as many times as you like and modify it by adding 
      attributes.
    instructions:
      - Open the plunker file
      - Import the google maps component
