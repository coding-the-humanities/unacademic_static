    In web development some key principles proved to be very important. 
    When working on a project, things can get complicated fast. 
    That is why we must consider the maintainability of the project.
    A project should be able to grow easily, for example by adding new features. 
    In order for numerous team members to collaborate, a team should be able to easily share their work. 
    Web components are a good way to enforce collaboration, 
    because you can add features by simply importing a component. 
    This method also results in clean and readable code. 
    With scalabality and maintainability in mind, components can be combined, stacked or replaced. 
    And most importantly because components are completely encapsulated, 
    it provides an easy way to share and reuse code.
    Working with web components is not only about creating your own custom elements but also about 
    incorporating other people's custom elements. 
    Why create something that has already been created?
    Instead of just collaborating with your team why not share your components with the world?
    This idea has ammassed an active community over time that share their components. 
    There are many components available;
    one could build an entire web app just from external components.

    Web components provide an easy way to share and reuse code.

      Polymer already provides many standardized custom elements that are useful for building your own
      web app. These components are designed to act as building blocks: you can mix and match and add your own.
      These components are a great way to get started with building a web app of your own. To help you
      visualize the way these components work together, Polymer has created a web tool called Designer.
      In Designer you can choose from all the web components Polymer has to offer and drag and drop
      them on the canvas.
    instructions:
      - Have a look at all the components out there
      - Open the Polymer Designer and start combining some components

      Google provides web developers with tools to incorporate Google services on their website.
      For example to incorporate Google maps, you need to do quite a bit of work to get it working.
      This includes creating markup, scripts and communicating with their API. These are steps one 
      have to take everytime they need to incorporate Google Maps. With the Google Maps custom element 
      this process is simplified. You can import the element with a single line. 
      You can then use it as many times as you like and modify it by adding attributes.
    instructions:
      - Open the plunker file
      - Import the Google maps component
