    You must be anxious to dive into the wonderful world of web programming.
    But the first thing we want you to do has sadly / luckily nothing to do with code.
    You must go out in the city of Amsterdam and follow one of the routes below.
    If you want you can also follow both routes, but that's at your own leisure.
    While you're walking your walk we want you to take as many pictures as you like,
    of things you think are interesting.

    The purpose of this odd request is that we want to encourage you to make content,
    which you are going to use in later assignments as content for your widgets and 
    other kinds of interfaces.

    There are two route options you only have to choose one! Make sure to save all your 
    pictures because your going to need them later on
